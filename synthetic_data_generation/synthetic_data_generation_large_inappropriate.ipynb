      "## The Use of Python Variables for Web Developer\n",
      "\n",
      "### Applications of Python Variables Intro for Web Developer\n",
      "\n",
      "In this chapter, we will discuss how to use Python Variables as a Web Developer. Python variables are important for web development because they allow us to store, retrieve, and manipulate data in a way that makes our code more efficient and readable.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Subsections:\n",
      "- Storing Data in Variables\n",
      "- Retrieving Data from Variables\n",
      "- Manipulating Data in Variables\n",
      "- Using Variables in Web Development\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Storing Data in Variables\n",
      "\n",
      "In Python, we can store data in variables using the equal sign `=`. Variables can store different types of data, including strings, integers, floats, and booleans. Here is an example of how to store data in a variable:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "name = \"John\"\n",
      "age = 25\n",
      "is_student = True\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, we have created three variables: `name`, `age`, and `is_student`. We have assigned the string value `\"John\"` to the `name` variable, the integer value `25` to the `age` variable, and the boolean value `True` to the `is_student` variable.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Retrieving Data from Variables\n",
      "\n",
      "Once we have stored data in a variable, we can retrieve the value from the variable using the `print` function. Here is an example of how to retrieve data from a variable:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "print(name) # prints \"John\"\n",
      "print(age) # prints 25\n",
      "print(is_student) # prints True\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, we have used the `print` function to retrieve the values from the `name`, `age`, and `is_student` variables and print them to the console.\n",

      "\n",
      "### Subsections:\n",

      "- Examples\n",

      "\n",
      "### Introduction\n",
      "List comprehension is a concise and fast way of creating lists. It provides a shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on the values of an existing list. List comprehension is a powerful tool for operations research analysts as it allows for the creation of new lists with just a few lines of code.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Syntax\n",
      "The basic syntax for list comprehension is as follows:\n",
      "```\n",
      "new_list = [expression(expression) for item in list]\n",
      "```\n",
      "where:\n",
      "- `new_list` is the name of the new list we want to create.\n",
      "- `expression` is the operation we want to do on each item in the list.\n",
      "- `item` is a variable used to represent the items in the list.\n",
      "- `list` is the name of the existing list we want to create a new list from.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Examples\n",
      "Let's look at some examples of list comprehension in action:\n",
      "- Example 1: Create a new list of even numbers from an existing list.\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Existing list\n",
      "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n",
      "\n",
      "# Create new list of even numbers\n",
      "even_numbers = [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]\n",
      "\n",
      "print(even_numbers)\n",
      "# Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n",
      "```\n",
      "- Example 2: Create a new list of squared numbers from an existing list.\n",
      "```python\n",
      "# Existing list\n",
      "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
      "\n",
      "# Create new list of squared numbers\n",
      "squared_numbers = [num ** 2 for num in numbers]\n",

      "## The `requests` module\n",
      "\n",
      "### Introduction\n",
      "\n",
      "The `requests` module is an essential tool for working with HTTP requests in Python. It is commonly used for making HTTP requests to web servers and APIs, as well as for sending data to those servers. In this chapter, we will explore some of the basic functions of the `requests` module and how to use them in your Python code.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Making GET Requests\n",
      "\n",
      "The most common HTTP request is the GET request, which is used to retrieve data from a server. To make a GET request with the `requests` module, you can use the `requests.get()` function.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is an example of a GET request that retrieves data from a weather API:\n",
      "\n",
      "```python\n",
      "import requests\n",
      "\n",
      "url = 'https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London,uk&appid=YOUR_API_KEY'\n",
      "\n",
      "response = requests.get(url)\n",
      "\n",
      "print(response.status_code)\n",
      "\n",
      "data = response.json()\n",
      "\n",
      "print(data)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, the `requests.get()` function is used to send a GET request to the weather API with the desired parameters. The response is stored in the `response` object, and the status code of the response is printed to the console.\n",
      "\n",
      "The data from the response is then parsed as JSON using the `.json()` method, and printed to the console. Note that you will need to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your own API key before running this code.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Making POST Requests\n",
      "\n",
      "Another common HTTP request is the POST request, which is used to submit data to a server. To make a POST request with the `requests` module, you can use the `requests.post\n",
      "Failed to parse JSON: substring not found\n",
      "Batch 148 took 19.94 seconds and generated 0 records.\n"
